# Virtual_Keyboard
the 2 main files are Keyboard.java and MyMidiPlayer.java
the others were created for reference and test of certain functions
Keyboard is a basic player that will create sound when playing on the keys of the computer. 
MyMidiPlayer is unfinished and is trying to have input from an external midi source play live on the computer.
The current way to use this code is to download it and compile and run the individual classes with a java compiler
I was using terminal, but it can also be done in any other java compiler.
